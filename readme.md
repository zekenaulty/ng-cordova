# Angular 8+ & Cordova with ios, browser, and Electron platforms

This boiler plate provides Angular and Cordova integration out of the gate. Angular workspace has no Apps/Modules and will need to be setup to build to Cordova workspace a.k.a. www

This boiler plate was built using: https://medium.com/@nacojohn/convert-your-angular-project-to-mobile-app-using-cordova-f0384a7711a6 as a loose guide...

When I say loose I mean I didn't actually read this, but skimmed it for fact checking... key points are the device ready hook and final steps of setup to configure build path

You will need to run: "ng g application MyApp" as this boiler plate only provides a angular workspace with integrated cordova.
